# Chromatic Sensitivity

Rimworld mod to make pawns more affected by the colours they interact with.

## Features
Most of the features of this mod are related to the `ChromaticSensitivity` Hediff.
If your pawn has this Hediff they can look forward to some of the following.

### You are what you eat
Eating food will slowly transform the pawn making them
* Approximately the same colour as their food
  * If they eat food with ingredients then the effect will be applied for each ingredient.
