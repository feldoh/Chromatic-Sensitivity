# Chromatic Sensitivity

Rimworld mod to make pawns more affected by the colours they interact with.

## Features
Most of the features of this mod are related to the `ChromaticSensitivity` Hediff.
If your pawn has this Hediff they can look forward to some of the following.

### You are what you eat
Eating food will slowly transform the pawn making them
* Approximately the same colour as their food
  * If they eat food with ingredients then the effect will be applied for each ingredient.

### Compatibility
* This should be compatible with Aliens defined using the [HAR Framework](https://github.com/erdelf/AlienRaces)
  * The color modification is applied to the first of the two color channels, it uses `skin` where possible or falls back to `base`.
* Combat extended - Probably ¯\\(ツ)/¯

## Contributing
Please do, this is my first published mod and I'm sure I've made mistakes.
Please let me know so I can learn or raise a PR yourself.
